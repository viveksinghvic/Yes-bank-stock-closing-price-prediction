# Yes-bank-stock-closing-price-prediction
Yes Bank is a prominent Indian bank that has been in the spotlight due to a high-profile fraud case involving its former CEO, Rana Kapoor, in 2018. This project aims to explore the impact of this case on the bank's stock prices. It seeks to determine whether time series models or other predictive models can effectively predict the bank's stock closing prices over time. The dataset used for this analysis contains monthly stock price data since the bank's inception, including opening, highest, lowest, and closing prices of each month.

Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the dataset, handling missing values, and converting data types as needed.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualize the stock price data to understand trends, seasonality, and any anomalies in the data.

Feature Engineering: Create relevant features or lag variables for time series analysis, which can aid in prediction.

Model Selection: Evaluate different regression models, such as linear regression and machine learning models like Random Forest or XGBoost, to find the most suitable model for predicting stock closing prices.

Model Training: Split the data into training and testing sets, and train the selected model.

Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and R-squared. Understand how well the model captures the variation in the stock prices.

Results and Insights: Summarize the findings, including insights into how the fraud case involving Rana Kapoor may or may not have affected Yes Bank's stock prices. Discuss the practical implications of the model's predictions.

This project aims to provide valuable insights into the factors influencing Yes Bank's stock prices and assess the predictive capabilities of various regression models. The results may assist investors and financial analysts in making informed decisions regarding the bank's stock.
